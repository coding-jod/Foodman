Namaste!
The app is hosted on : https://foodman-seven.vercel.app/ 
This is Pratham Agarwal's github repo for a Food Ordering Website. It's not the normal static frontend it is using real time data fetched from Firebase using it's API and real time database.
This was a Practice Project and was created using React JS hooks, along with custom JSX to build a visually appealing frontend for the client. 
I have implemented the following features in this app:
  1. We enter directly onto the home page where we have which are fetched from Firebase's real time database.
    --> Home Page:

  2. On adding products to the cart the number attached changes and also the cart gets updated in real time.
     --> Cart Button UI:

  3. On confirming the order by clicking the Order button:  a form appears to be filled by the user who wants to place the order.

     The form also deals with errors where a field is left blank or some other field specific validation.

  4. After filling the form, and clicking on Order button , a message for succesful order pops up as shown below:
     --> Success Message POPup:

I tried to explain every feature in depth. But I would still love it if you could pay a visit to my app. Also, any feedback is duly appreciated.
